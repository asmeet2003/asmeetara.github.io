The sport is played for recreation and is also played at a formal sporting level with organized competition that involves major tournaments, professional teams, and playersPaintball technology is also used by military forces, law enforcement, paramilitary, and security organizations to supplement military or other training.

Games can be played on indoor or outdoor fields of varying sizes</p>
